        <h1>Guide to Spring Bean Scopes</h1>
        <p>In this guide, we will learn the different types of bean scopes in the Spring framework.</p>
        <p> Spring Framework supports following bean scopes :</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>singleton: </b>(Default) Scopes a single bean definition to a single object instance per Spring IoC
                container.</li>
            <li><b>prototype: </b>Scopes a single bean definition to any number of object instances.</li>
            <li><b>request: </b>Scopes a single bean definition to the lifecycle of a single HTTP request; that is, each
                HTTP request has its own instance of a bean created off the back of a single bean definition. Only valid
                in the context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.</li>
            <li><b>session: </b>Scopes a single bean definition to the lifecycle of an HTTP Session. Only valid in the
                context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.
            </li>
            <li><b>application: </b>Scopes a single bean definition to the lifecycle of a ServletContext. Only valid in
                the context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.</li>
            <li><b>WebSocket: </b>Scopes a single bean definition to the lifecycle of a WebSocket. Only valid in the
                context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The singleton scope</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Only one shared an instance of a singleton bean is managed, and all requests for beans with an id or ids
            matching that bean definition result in that one specific bean instance being returned by the Spring
            container.</p>
        <p>To put it another way, when you define a bean definition and it is scoped as a <b>singleton</b>, the
            <b>Spring IoC
                container</b> creates exactly one instance of the object defined by that bean definition. This single
            instance
            is stored in a cache of such singleton beans, and all subsequent requests and references for that named bean
            return the cached object.
        </p>

        <h4>Key points</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Spring’s concept of a singleton bean differs from the <a
                    href="https://www.sourcecodeexamples.net/2017/12/singleton-design-pattern.html"
                    target="_blank">Singleton Pattern</a> as defined in the Gang of Four
                (GoF) patterns book. The GoF Singleton hard-codes the scope of an object such that one and only one
                instance of a particular class is created per ClassLoader.</li>
            <li>Spring Singleton beans are not threaded safe.</li>
            <li>The singleton scope is the default scope in Spring.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To define a bean as a singleton in XML, we would write, for example:</p>
        <pre><code>
&ltbean id="accountService" class="com.foo.DefaultAccountService"/>

&lt!-- the following is equivalent, though redundant (singleton scope is the default) --&gt
&ltbean id="accountService" class="com.foo.DefaultAccountService" scope="singleton"/>
        </code></pre>
        <p>To define a bean as a <b>singleton</b> in <b>java based bean configuration</b>, we would write, for example:
        </p>
        <h2>The prototype scope</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>The non-singleton, prototype scope of bean deployment results in the creation of a new bean instance every
            time a request for that specific bean is made. That is, the bean is injected into another bean or you
            request it through a <b>getBean()</b> method call on the container. </p>
        <code
            style="color: red"><h3>As a rule, use the prototype scope for all stateful beans and the singleton scope for stateless beans.</h3></code>
        <p>The following diagram illustrates the Spring prototype scope. A data access object (DAO) is not typically
            configured as a prototype, because a typical <b>DAO</b> does not hold any conversational state; it was just
            easier
            for this author to reuse the core of the singleton diagram. The following example defines a bean as a
            prototype in XML:</p>
        <pre><code>
&ltbean id="accountService" class="com.foo.DefaultAccountService" scope="prototype"/>
```xml
To define a bean as a prototype in java based bean configuration, you would write, for example:
```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfiguration {

 @Bean
 @Scope("prototype")
 public UserService userService(){
  return new UserService();
 }
}
            </code></pre>
        <p>In contrast to the other scopes, Spring does not manage the complete lifecycle of a prototype bean: the
            container instantiates, configures, and otherwise assembles a prototype object, and hands it to the client,
            with no further record of that prototype instance.</p>
        <h2>Singleton beans with prototype-bean dependencies</h2>
        <p>When you use singleton-scoped beans with dependencies on prototype beans, be aware that dependencies are
            resolved at instantiation time. Thus if you dependency-inject a prototype-scoped bean into a
            singleton-scoped bean, a new prototype bean is instantiated and then dependency-injected into the singleton
            bean. The prototype instance is the sole instance that is ever supplied to the singleton-scoped bean.</p>
        <p>However, suppose you want the singleton-scoped bean to acquire a new instance of the prototype-scoped bean
            repeatedly at runtime. You cannot dependency-inject a prototype-scoped bean into your singleton bean,
            because that injection occurs only once, when the Spring container is instantiating the singleton bean and
            resolving and injecting its dependencies. If you need a new instance of a prototype bean at runtime more
            than once, see Method injection</p>
        <h2>Request, session, application, and WebSocket scopes</h2>
        <p>The <b></b>request, <b>session</b>, <b>application</b>, and <b>websocket</b> scopes are only available if you
            use a web-aware Spring
            ApplicationContext implementation (such as XmlWebApplicationContext). If you use these scopes with regular
            Spring IoC containers such as the ClassPathXmlApplicationContext, an IllegalStateException will be thrown
            complaining about an unknown bean scope.</p>
        <h2>Initial web configuration</h2>
        <p>To support the scoping of beans at the request, session, application, and websocket levels (web-scoped
            beans), some minor initial configuration is required before you define your beans. (This initial setup is
            not required for the standard scopes, singleton and prototype.)</p>
        <p>How you accomplish this initial setup depends on your particular Servlet environment.</p>
        <p>If you access scoped beans within Spring Web MVC, in effect, within a request that is processed by the Spring
            DispatcherServlet, then no special setup is necessary: DispatcherServlet already exposes all relevant state.
        </p>
        <p>If you use a Servlet 2.5 web container, with requests processed outside of Spring’s DispatcherServlet (for
            example, when using JSF or Struts), you need to register the
            org.springframework.web.context.request.RequestContextListener ServletRequestListener. For Servlet 3.0+,
            this can be done programmatically via the WebApplicationInitializer interface. Alternatively, or for older
            containers, add the following declaration to your web application’s web.xml file:</p>
        <pre><code>
&ltweb-app>
    ...
    &ltlistener>
        &ltlistener-class>
            org.springframework.web.context.request.RequestContextListener
        &lt/listener-class>
    &lt/listener>
    ...
&lt/web-app>
            </code></pre>
        <p>Alternatively, if there are issues with your listener setup, consider using Spring’s RequestContextFilter.
            The filter mapping depends on the surrounding web application configuration, so you have to change it as
            appropriate.</p>
        <pre><code>
&ltweb-app>
    ...
    &ltfilter>
        &ltfilter-name>requestContextFilter</filter-name>
        &ltfilter-class>org.springframework.web.filter.RequestContextFilter</filter-class>
    &lt/filter>
    &ltfilter-mapping>
        &ltfilter-name>requestContextFilter</filter-name>
        &lturl-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
    &lt/filter-mapping>
    ...
&lt/web-app>
            </code></pre>
        <p>DispatcherServlet, RequestContextListener, and RequestContextFilter all do exactly the same thing, namely
            bind the HTTP request object to the Thread that is servicing that request. This makes beans that are
            request- and session-scoped available further down the call chain.</p>
        <h2>Request scope</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Consider the following XML configuration for a bean definition:</p>
        <pre><code>&ltbean id="loginAction" class="com.foo.LoginAction" scope="request"/&gt</code></pre>
        <p>The Spring container creates a new instance of the LoginAction bean by using the loginAction bean definition
            for each and every HTTP request. That is, the loginAction bean is scoped at the HTTP request level. You can
            change the internal state of the instance that is created as much as you want because other instances
            created from the same loginAction bean definition will not see these changes in state; they are particular
            to an individual request. When the request completes processing, the bean that is scoped to the request is
            discarded.</p>
        <p>When using annotation-driven components or Java Config, the @RequestScope annotation can be used to assign a
            component to the request scope.</p>
        <pre><code>
@RequestScope
@Component
public class LoginAction {
    // ...
}
            </code></pre>
        <h2>Session scope</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Consider the following XML configuration for a bean definition:</p>
        <pre><code>&ltbean id="userPreferences" class="com.foo.UserPreferences" scope="session"/&gt</code></pre>
        <p>The Spring container creates a new instance of the UserPreferences bean by using the userPreferences bean
            definition for the lifetime of a single HTTP Session. In other words, the userPreferences bean is
            effectively scoped at the HTTP Session level. As with request-scoped beans, you can change the internal
            state of the instance that is created as much as you want, knowing that other HTTP Session instances that
            are also using instances created from the same userPreferences bean definition do not see these changes in
            state, because they are particular to an individual HTTP Session. When the HTTP Session is eventually
            discarded, the bean that is scoped to that particular HTTP Session is also discarded.</p>
        <p>When using annotation-driven components or Java Config, the <b>@SessionScope</b> annotation can be used to
            assign a
            component to the session scope.</p>
        <pre><code>
@SessionScope
@Component
public class UserPreferences {
    // ...
}
            </code></pre>
        <h2>Application scope</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Consider the following XML configuration for a bean definition:</p>
        <pre><code>&ltbean id="appPreferences" class="com.foo.AppPreferences" scope="application"/&gt</code></pre>
        <p>The Spring container creates a new instance of the AppPreferences bean by using the appPreferences bean
            definition once for the entire web application. That is, the appPreferences bean is scoped at the
            ServletContext level, stored as a regular ServletContext attribute. This is somewhat similar to a Spring
            singleton bean but differs in two important ways: It is a singleton per ServletContext, not per Spring
            'ApplicationContext' (for which there may be several in any given web application), and it is actually
            exposed and therefore visible as a ServletContext attribute.</p>
        <p>When using annotation-driven components or Java Config, the <b>@ApplicationScope</b> annotation can be used
            to assign a component to the application scope.</p>
        <pre><code>
@ApplicationScope
@Component
public class AppPreferences {
    // ...
}
            </code></pre>
