          SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is a language used to interact with the database, i.e to create a database, to create a table in the database, to retrieve data or update a table in the database, etc. SQL is an ANSI(American National Standards Institute) standard. Using SQL, we can do many things. For example – we can execute queries, we can insert records into a table, can update records, can create a database, can create a table, can delete a table, etc.</div>

            A Database is defined as a structured form of data storage in a computer or a collection of data in an organized manner and can be accessed in various ways. It is also the collection of schemas, tables, queries, views, etc. Databases help us with easily storing, accessing, and manipulating data held on a computer. The Database Management System allows a user to interact with the database.</div>

            It is true that SQL is a language, but it does not support programming as it is not a programming language, it is a command language. We do not have conditional statements in SQL like for loops or if..else, we only have commands which we can use to query, update, delete, etc. data in the database. SQL allows us to manipulate data in a database.

            Both of these data types are used for characters, but varchar2 is used for character strings of variable length, whereas char is used for character strings of fixed length. For example, if we specify the type as char(5) then we will not be allowed to store a string of any other length in this variable, but if we specify the type of this variable as varchar2(5) then we will be allowed to store strings of variable length. We can store a string of length 3 or 4 or 2 in this variable. </div>

            Views in SQL are a kind of virtual table. A view also has rows and columns as they are on a real table in the database. We can create a view by selecting fields from one or more tables present in the database. A View can either have all the rows of a table or specific rows based on certain conditions. 

            The CREATE VIEW statement of SQL is used for creating views. 
            <pre>
            Basic Syntax: 
            
            CREATE VIEW view_name AS
            SELECT column1, column2.....
            FROM table_name
            WHERE condition;
            
            view_name: Name for the View
            table_name: Name of the table
            condition: Condition to select rows
            For more details on how to create and use view, please refer to this article.</pre></div>

            A Foreign key is a field that can uniquely identify each row in another table. And this constraint is used to specify a field as a Foreign key. That is this field points to the primary key of another table. This usually creates a kind of link between the two tables. 
            Consider the two tables as shown below: 
            <pre>
            
            Orders
            
            O_ID	ORDER_NO	C_ID
            1	2253	3
            2	3325	3
            3	4521	2
            4	8532	1
            Customers
            
            C_ID	NAME	ADDRESS
            1	RAMESH	DELHI
            2	SURESH	NOIDA
            3	DHARMESH	GURGAON
            As we can see clearly, that the field C_ID in the Orders table is the primary key in the Customers’ table, i.e. it uniquely identifies each row in the Customers table. Therefore, it is a Foreign Key in the Orders table. 
            
            Syntax: 
            
            CREATE TABLE Orders

            O_ID int NOT NULL,

            Denormalization is a database optimization technique in which we add redundant data to one or more tables. This can help us avoid costly joins in a relational database. Note that denormalization does not mean not doing normalization. It is an optimization technique that is applied after normalization. 

In a traditional normalized database, we store data in separate logical tables and attempt to minimize redundant data. We may strive to have only one copy of each piece of data in the database.

            An SQL query is used to retrieve the required data from the database. However, there may be multiple SQL queries that yield the same results but with different levels of efficiency. An inefficient query can drain the database resources, reduce the database speed or result in a loss of service for other users. So it is very important to optimize the query to obtain the best database performance.

            Sometimes, while creating a table, we do not have a unique identifier within the table, hence we face difficulty in choosing Primary Key. So as to resolve such an issue, we’ve to manually provide unique keys to every record, but this is often also a tedious task. So we can use the  Auto-Increment feature that automatically generates a numerical Primary key value for every new record inserted. The Auto Increment feature is supported by all the Databases.

            User-Defined Functions allow people to define their own T-SQL functions that can accept 0 or more parameters and return a single scalar data value or a table data type.
Different Kinds of User-Defined Functions created are:

1. Scalar User-Defined Function A Scalar user-defined function returns one of the scalar data types. Text, image, and timestamp data types are not supported. These are the type of user-defined functions that most developers are used to in other programming languages. You pass in 0 to many parameters and you get a return value.

2. Inline Table-Value User-Defined Function An Inline Table-Value user-defined function returns a table data type and is an exceptional alternative to a view as the user-defined function can pass parameters into a T-SQL select command and, in essence, provide us with a parameterized, non-updateable view of the underlying tables.

3. Multi-statement Table-Value User-Defined Function A Multi-Statement Table-Value user-defined function returns a table and is also an exceptional alternative to a view, as the function can support multiple T-SQL statements to build the final result where the view is limited to a single SELECT statement. Also, the ability to pass parameters into a TSQL select command or a group of them gives us the capability to, in essence, create a parameterized, non-updateable view of the data in the underlying tables. Within the create function command you must define the table structure that is being returned. After creating this type of user-defined function, it can be used in the FROM clause of a T-SQL command, unlike the behavior found when using a stored procedure which can also return record sets.</div>

Aggregate functions: These functions are used to do operations from the values of the column and a single value is returned.
Scalar functions: These functions are based on user input, these too return a single value.

            Aliases are the temporary names given to a table or column for the purpose of a particular SQL query. It is used when the name of a column or table is used other than its original name, but the modified name is only temporary.


            Aliases are created to make table or column names more readable.
            The renaming is just a temporary change and the table name does not change in the original database.
            Aliases are useful when table or column names are big or not very readable.
            These are preferred when there is more than one table involved in a query.
            For more details, please read the SQL | Aliases article.

            Set Operations in SQL eliminate duplicate tuples and can be applied only to the relations which are union compatible. Set Operations available in SQL are :

Set Union
Set Intersection
Set Difference
UNION Operation: This operation includes all the tuples which are present in either of the relations. For example: To find all the customers who have a loan or an account or both in a bank.

 SELECT CustomerName FROM Depositor 
 UNION 
 SELECT CustomerName FROM Borrower ;
The union operation automatically eliminates duplicates. If all the duplicates are supposed to be retained, UNION ALL is used in place of UNION. 

INTERSECT Operation: This operation includes the tuples which are present in both of the relations. For example: To find the customers who have a loan as well as an account in the bank:

 SELECT CustomerName FROM Depositor 
 INTERSECT
 SELECT CustomerName FROM Borrower ;
The Intersect operation automatically eliminates duplicates. If all the duplicates are supposed to be retained, INTERSECT ALL is used in place of INTERSECT. 

EXCEPT for Operation: This operation includes tuples that are present in one relationship but should not be present in another relationship. For example: To find customers who have an account but no loan at the bank:

 SELECT CustomerName FROM Depositor 
 EXCEPT
 SELECT CustomerName FROM Borrower ;
The Except operation automatically eliminates the duplicates. If all the duplicates are supposed to be retained, EXCEPT ALL is used in place of EXCEPT.</pre></div>

            T-SQL is an abbreviation for Transact Structure Query Language. It is a product by Microsoft and is an extension of SQL Language which is used to interact with relational databases. It is considered to perform best with Microsoft SQL servers. T-SQL statements are used to perform the transactions to the databases. T-SQL has huge importance since all the communications with an instance of an SQL server are done by sending Transact-SQL statements to the server. Users can also define functions using T-SQL.

            Types of T-SQL functions are :
            
            
            Aggregate functions.

        SQL is a query execution or commanding language   PL/SQL is a complete programming language
        
        SQL is a data-oriented language.                  PL/SQL is a procedural language
        
        SQL is very declarative in nature.                PL/SQL has a procedural nature.
        
        It is used for manipulating data.                 It is used for creating applications.
        
        We can execute one statement at a time in SQL     We can execute blocks of statements in PL/SQL
        
        SQL tells databases, what to do?                  PL/SQL tells databases how to do.

This query will select all those rows from the table. Students where the value of the field ROLL_NO lies between 20 and 30. 
IN: The IN operator is used to check for values contained in specific sets. 
For example, 

SELECT * FROM Students

        An SQL Join statement is used to combine data or rows from two or more tables based on a common field between them. Different types of Joins are: 

        INNER JOIN: The INNER JOIN keyword selects all rows from both tables as long as the condition is satisfied. This keyword will create the result set by combining all rows from both the tables where the condition satisfies i.e. the value of the common field will be the same.
        LEFT JOIN: This join returns all the rows of the table on the left side of the join and matching rows for the table on the right side of the join. For the rows for which there is no matching row on the right side, the result set will be null. LEFT JOIN is also known as LEFT OUTER JOIN
        RIGHT JOIN: RIGHT JOIN is similar to LEFT JOIN. This join returns all the rows of the table on the right side of the join and matching rows for the table on the left side of the join. For the rows for which there is no matching row on the left side, the result set will contain null. RIGHT JOIN is also known as RIGHT OUTER JOIN.
        FULL JOIN: FULL JOIN creates the result set by combining the results of both LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN. The result set will contain all the rows from both tables. For the rows for which there is no matching, the result set will contain NULL values.</pre></div>
