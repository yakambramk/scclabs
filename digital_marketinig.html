                              <p>Search engine optimization (SEO) is the practice of increasing the quantity and quality of traffic to your website through organic search engine results. You might think of a search engine as a website you visit to type (or speak) into, following which a search engine would promptly answer your questions by way of a series of prospective web pages.
                                  <br>Now, that is true. But have you ever stopped to consider what works behind those magical lists of links?
                                  <br>Here's how it works: Google (or any other search engine that you are using) has a crawler that goes out and gathers information about all the content they can find on the Internet. The crawlers bring all those 1s and 0s back to the search engine to build an index. That index is then fed through an algorithm that tries to match all that data with your query. This much of technical matter has to go into every ‘search’ that you may perform!</p>

                              <p>The extensive reach and impact of social media is something that is all out there. In the current business scenario, to get a word about a product, brand or launch across, one does not have to make calls, send emails or spend on celebrity endorsements, really. Just one post on a social media platform like Facebook or Instagram and the job is done. The word will automatically spread. Ever wondered why every restaurant, store and even clinic, has an exclusive social media page nowadays? There’s your answer.</p>

                              <p>PPC is an online advertising model in which advertisers can display ads for their goods or services when users enter relevant queries into search engines. Advertisers are only charged when a user actually clicks on their ad, hence the name “pay-per-click.” Due to the nature of keywords and the role they play in a paid search, pay-per-click advertising can also be referred to as keyword advertising.
                                  <br>In order for the ads to appear alongside the results on a search engine (commonly referred to as a Search Engine Results Page, or SERP), advertisers cannot simply pay more to ensure that their ads appear more prominently than that of their competitors’. Thus, ads are subjected to what is known as the Ad Auction, an entirely automated process that Google and other major search engines use, so as to determine the relevance and validity of advertisements that appear on their SERPs. It is another novel advertising that will surely benefit your product or company immensely, in the long run.</p>

                                  <br>Content marketing must align with your overall marketing strategy, business goals, and target audience. Once you have a clear understanding of these factors, you can begin developing a content marketing plan.

                                  <br>When creating content, it is important to consider what will resonate with your target audience. The most successful content is interesting, useful, and relevant to your readers. It should also be shareable so that your readers can easily pass it along to their own networks.</p>
