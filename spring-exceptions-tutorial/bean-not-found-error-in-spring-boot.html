        <h1>Bean Not Found Error in Spring Boot</h1>
        <p>The "bean not found" error in a Spring Boot application usually indicates that the Spring container couldn't
            locate a specific bean you've referenced. This can be due to a variety of reasons. In this post, we will
            discuss some common causes and their solutions.</p>
        <h2>1. Component Scanning Issues</h2>
        <p><strong>Cause:</strong> The bean might not be in a package that's being scanned by Spring.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Ensure that your main Spring Boot application class (the class annotated with
            <code style="color: red;">@SpringBootApplication</code>) is in a root package above all your other classes.
            The
            <code style="color: red;">@SpringBootApplication</code> annotation includes <code
                style="color: red;">@ComponentScan</code> which will scan the
            package it's in and all sub-packages.
        </p>
        <p>If you have beans in a different package structure, you may need to explicitly tell Spring to scan that
            package using <code style="color: red;">@ComponentScan("package.name.to.scan")</code>.</p>
        <h2>2. Missing Annotations</h2>
        <p><strong>Cause:</strong> The class you're trying to use as a bean might not have been annotated as a
            <code style="color: red;">@Component</code> or its variants (<code style="color: red;">@Service</code>,
            <code style="color: red;">@Repository</code>,
            <code style="color: red;">@Controller</code>, etc.).
        </p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Add the appropriate annotation to the class.</p>
        <pre><code>
For Service class:

@Service
public class MyService { 
    // ...
}

For controller class:

@Controller
public class MyController { 
    // ...
}

For a Spring component:

@Component
public class MyComponent { 
    // ...
}

For Spring Data JPA Repository:

@Repository
public class MyRepository { 
    // ...
}
        </code></pre>

        <h2>3. Profile-specific Beans</h2>
        <p><strong>Cause:</strong> If you're using Spring Profiles, the bean might be defined under a specific profile
            that is not currently active.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Ensure the correct profile is active when running the application. Check if the
            bean is marked with <code style="color: red;">@Profile</code> annotation and see which profile it belongs
            to.</p>
        <h2>4. Java Configuration Issues</h2>
        <p><strong>Cause:</strong> You might have Java configuration (<code style="color: red;">@Configuration</code>
            classes) where the
            bean is defined, but that configuration isn't being picked up.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Ensure that your Java configuration class itself is being picked up by the
            component scanner. If you've defined the bean in a Java configuration using <code
                style="color: red;">@Bean</code>, ensure
            you're returning the correct instance type.</p>
        <h2>5. Constructor Injection Without Autowiring</h2>
        <p><strong>Cause:</strong> You're using constructor-based injection but forgot to add the
            <code style="color: red;">@Autowired</code> annotation.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Ensure that the constructors you want Spring to use for injection are annotated
            with <code style="color: red;">@Autowired</code>. In newer versions of Spring, you can omit the <code
                style="color: red;">@Autowired</code>
            annotation on single-constructor classes, but it's a good practice to include it for clarity.</p>
        <h2>6. Mistyped Bean Name</h2>
        <p><strong>Cause:</strong> When you're manually specifying a bean name using <code
                style="color: red;">@Qualifier</code> or in XML
            configurations, there's a possibility of a typo.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Double-check the bean names. Make sure it matches the name of the bean you're
            trying to reference.</p>
        <h2>7. External Dependencies</h2>
        <p><strong>Cause:</strong> You might be trying to use a bean that's part of an external library or starter, but
            you forgot to include that dependency in your <code style="color: red;">pom.xml</code> or <code
                style="color: red;">build.gradle</code>.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Ensure all necessary dependencies are included and correctly versioned in your
            build file.</p>
        <h2>8. Singleton vs. Prototype Scope</h2>
        <p><strong>Cause:</strong> By default, beans are singletons in Spring. If you're trying to create a new instance
            each time, but you haven't specified the correct scope, you might run into issues.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> If you want a new instance every time a bean is requested, make sure to mark the
            bean as <code style="color: red;">@Scope("prototype")</code>.</p>
        <h2>9. Application Context Issues</h2>
        <p><strong>Cause:</strong> If you're manually creating an <code style="color: red;">ApplicationContext</code> or using multiple
            contexts, beans from one might not be available in another.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Ensure that you're working with the correct <code
                style="color: red;">ApplicationContext</code> and
            that all configurations are loaded.</p>
        <p>In debugging "bean not found" errors, carefully reading the error message and stack trace can provide
            valuable insights. The message usually specifies which Spring bean it couldn't find and can give you clues
            on where to start investigating.</p>
