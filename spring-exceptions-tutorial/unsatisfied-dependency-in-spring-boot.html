        <h1>Unsatisfied Dependency in Spring Boot</h1>
        <p>Spring Framework, at its core, revolves around the concept of Dependency Injection (DI). The framework
            manages the life cycle of beans and ensures that they are provided with the necessary dependencies.</p>

        <p>However, occasionally, there can be issues with the dependency resolution, resulting in the
            <strong>UnsatisfiedDependencyException</strong>. This article will explore this exception, its causes, and
            potential solutions.
        </p>

        <h2>What is UnsatisfiedDependencyException?</h2>
        <p>The UnsatisfiedDependencyException typically occurs during the Spring container's bean creation process. It
            indicates that one of the dependencies required for creating a bean cannot be satisfied. The error message
            will typically look something like this:</p>

        <pre>org.springframework.beans.factory.UnsatisfiedDependencyException: Error creating bean with name 'someBeanName': 
Unsatisfied dependency expressed through field 'someFieldName'; nested exception is ...</pre>
        <p>This error is thrown when Spring's Inversion of Control (IoC) container cannot resolve a dependency required
            to create a bean. Let's dive into why this happens and how to fix it.</p>
        <h2>Causes</h2>
        <p><b>Missing Annotations: </b>The required bean may not be marked as a Spring component (<b>@Component</b>,
            <b>@Service</b>,
            <b>@Repository</b>, <b>@Controller</b>, etc.).
        </p>
        <p><b>Component Scan Issues: </b>Spring might not be scanning the package where your component is located. This
            can be
            due to misconfiguration or oversight.</p>
        <p><b>Multiple Beans: </b>Sometimes, there might be multiple beans of the desired type, and Spring cannot decide
            which
            one to inject.</p>
        <p><b>Profile-specific Beans: </b></p>The bean to be injected might be annotated with a specific profile, and
        that profile
        might not be active.</p>
        <p><b>Other Configuration Errors: </b>XML-based configurations or Java-based configurations might have errors,
            or they
            might not be picked up by Spring at all.</p>
        <h2>Solutions</h2>
        <h3>Add Missing Annotations</h3>
        <p>Make sure that you annotated a class with respective Spring annotation to make that class a Spring bean.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="/spring-mvc/spring-component-annotation-example.html" target="_blank">@Component: </a>This is a
                generic stereotype annotation to indicate that a class is a Spring
                component.</li>
            <li><a href="/spring-core-tutorial/spring-service-annotation.html" target="_blank">@Service: </a>This
                denotes a class as a service layer, and it's a specialization of the
                @Component annotation.</li>
            <li><a href="/spring-mvc/spring-repository-annotation.html" target="_blank">@Repository: </a>This is used on
                classes that directly access the database. </li>
            <li><a href="/spring-exceptions-tutorial/spring-controller-annotation-example.html"
                    target="_blank">@Controller: </a>Used with classes that act as web controllers in a Spring MVC
                application.
            </li>
            <li><a href="">@RestController: </a>This is a combination of @Controller and @ResponseBody and is commonly
                used for creating RESTful web services in Spring Boot applications.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>For example: </b>If a required bean is missing an annotation, it won't be registered in the Spring
            context.
            Here's how to fix it: Let's say you have a class <code style="color: red;">SomeService</code> which is
            supposed to be a Spring-managed
            bean, but you forgot to annotate it:</p>
        <pre><code>
public class SomeService {
    // ... class content ...
}
                </code></pre>
        <p>To allow Spring to manage this class as a bean and inject it wherever needed, you should annotate it with the
            appropriate annotation:</p>
        <pre><code>
@Service
public class SomeService {
    // ... class content ...
}
                </code></pre>
        <p>Now, Spring will recognize <code style="color: red;">SomeService</code> as a managed bean, and it will be
            eligible for auto-wiring wherever it's needed.</p>
        <h3>Fix Component Scanning</h3>
        <p>If using @SpringBootApplication in Spring Boot, by default, it will scan all sub-packages of the package
            where it's located. Make sure your main application class is in a root package above other classes.
            Alternatively, you can specify the packages to scan using the <code
                style="color: red;">@ComponentScan</code> annotation:</p>
        <pre><code>
@SpringBootApplication
@ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.example")
public class MyApplication {
    // ...
}

</code></pre>
        <h3>Qualify Your Beans</h3>
        <p>If multiple beans of the same type exist, use the <a href="/spring-core-tutorial/spring-qualifier-annotation-example.html" target="_blank">@Qualifier</a> annotation to specify which bean
            to inject:</p>
        <pre><code>
@Autowired
public SomeService(@Qualifier("specificBeanName") SomeClass someClass) {
    // ...
}

</code></pre>
        <h3>Check Profiles</h3>
        <p>If the bean definition is bound to a specific profile using the <code style="color: red;">@Profile</code>
            annotation, ensure that the profile is active. </p>
        <h3>Review Configuration</h3>
        <p>Examine XML-based or Java-based configurations for errors. Also, ensure they are located in a package scanned
            by Spring or explicitly imported. </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The <code style="color: red;">UnsatisfiedDependencyException</code> error essentially means that Spring
            couldn't find a matching bean for the
            given dependency. By carefully inspecting your configuration and understanding the cause, you can usually
            resolve this error quite quickly.
