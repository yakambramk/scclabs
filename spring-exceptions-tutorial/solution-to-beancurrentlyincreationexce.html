        <h1>Solution to BeanCurrentlyInCreationException Error in Spring Boot</h1>
        <p>In Spring, <code style="color: red;">BeanCurrentlyInCreationException</code> is an exception that occurs when
            there's a
            circular dependency during bean creation, and Spring's dependency injection mechanism can't resolve it. This
            usually happens when using constructor-based injection. Let's dive deeper into the cause and resolution of
            this error.</p>
        <h2>Cause</h2>
        <p>Consider the following scenario:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>BeanA</b> requires an instance of <b>BeanB</b> in its constructor.</li>
            <li><b>BeanB</b>, in turn, requires an instance of BeanA in its constructor.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now, when Spring tries to create an instance of <b>BeanA</b>, it realizes it first needs to create
            <b>BeanB</b>. However,
            to create <b>BeanB</b>, it needs <b>BeanA</b>, leading to a circular dependency. Since both beans are
            currently in the
            creation process and depend on each other, Spring throws the <code
                style="color: red;">BeanCurrentlyInCreationException</code>.
        </p>
        <h2>Does Using Setter or Field Injection solve the issue?</h2>
        <p>No. In modern versions of Spring, the container will detect circular dependencies regardless of whether
            you're using constructor or setter/field-based injection.</p>
        <p>If both beans (or a chain of beans) have setter or field-based injections for one another, it would still
            result in a circular dependency, and Spring would throw <code
                style="color: red;">BeanCurrentlyInCreationException</code>.</p>
        <h2>How to Resolve</h2>
        <h3>1. Rethink the Design:</h3>
        <p>This is the most recommended approach. If there's a circular dependency, it might be an indication that the
            design can be improved. Can you split the functionality of one of the beans or introduce an intermediary
            service or bean?</p>
        <h3>2. Using the @Lazy Annotation:</h3>
        <p>This is one of the most common ways to resolve such an issue. By marking one of the beans as
            <code style="color: red;">@Lazy</code>, you're telling Spring to delay its instantiation until it's actually needed.
        </p>
        <pre><code>@Component
public class BeanA {
    private BeanB beanB;

    @Autowired
    public void setBeanB(@Lazy BeanB beanB) {
        this.beanB = beanB;
    }
}

@Component
public class BeanB {
    private BeanA beanA;

    @Autowired
    public void setBeanA(BeanA beanA) {
        this.beanA = beanA;
    }
}</code></pre>
        <h3>3. @PostConstruct Initialization:</h3>
        <p>If the circular dependency arises due to some logic in the initialization of the beans, try to defer that
            logic using the <code style="color: red;">@PostConstruct</code> annotation. This ensures that both beans are fully constructed
            before the logic runs.</p>
        <pre><code>@Component
public class BeanA {
    @Autowired
    private BeanB beanB;

    @PostConstruct
    public void init() {
        // Operations that involve beanB
    }
}</code></pre>

        <h3>4. Java Config for Bean Creation:</h3>
        <p>Explicitly control the creation of beans using Java configuration to manage their dependencies.</p>
        <pre><code>@Configuration
public class BeanConfig {

    @Bean
    @Lazy
    public BeanA beanA() {
        return new BeanA();
    }

    @Bean
    public BeanB beanB(BeanA beanA) {
        BeanB beanB = new BeanB();
        beanB.setBeanA(beanA);
        return beanB;
    }
}</code></pre>

        <p>The important takeaway here is that while Spring provides mechanisms to handle circular dependencies, it's a
            design smell. Circular dependencies can make the code harder to maintain and test. Consider reevaluating the
            design and responsibilities of your components to see if the circularity can be eliminated.</p>
